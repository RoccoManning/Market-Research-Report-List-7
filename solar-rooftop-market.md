<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Rooftop Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid Type</li><li>Off- Grid Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar rooftop market is classified into two main types: on-grid and off-grid systems. On-grid solar rooftops are connected to the local utility grid, allowing users to sell excess energy back and draw power when needed, enhancing energy efficiency and reducing costs. In contrast, off-grid systems operate independently, relying on battery storage for power, making them ideal for remote locations without grid access. Both types contribute to sustainable energy, but cater to different energy needs and geographic conditions.</p></p>
