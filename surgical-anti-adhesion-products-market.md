<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Anti-Adhesion Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Films</li><li>Gels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Surgical Anti-Adhesion Products market primarily consists of two types: films and gels. Films are thin, flexible layers placed between tissues and organs during surgery to hinder scar tissue formation. They provide a physical barrier that reduces adhesion risks. Gels, on the other hand, are viscous substances applied to surgical sites, creating a moist environment that facilitates healing while preventing tissues from sticking together. Both forms are designed to enhance patient recovery and reduce complications related to adhesions post-surgery.</p></p>
