<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hard Contact Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas Permeable Lenses</li><li>Hybrid Contact Lenses</li><li>PMMA Lenses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hard contact lens market comprises three primary types: Gas Permeable (GP) lenses, Hybrid lenses, and PMMA lenses. GP lenses allow oxygen to pass through, promoting eye health and comfort while providing clear vision. Hybrid lenses combine a rigid center with a soft skirt, offering the best of both worlds—sharp vision and comfort. PMMA lenses, made from polymethyl methacrylate, are rigid and durable but lack oxygen permeability, making them less popular for long-term wear compared to GP lenses.</p></p>
