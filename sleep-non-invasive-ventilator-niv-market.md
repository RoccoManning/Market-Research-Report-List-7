<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sleep Non invasive Ventilator NIV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPAP Ventilator</li><li>BIPAP Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Sleep Non-Invasive Ventilator (NIV) market primarily comprises CPAP and BiPAP ventilators. CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) devices deliver a steady airflow to keep airways open during sleep, making them ideal for obstructive sleep apnea. In contrast, BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) ventilators provide two pressure settings: a higher one for inhalation and a lower one for exhalation, catering to patients with more complex respiratory issues. Both types are essential in improving sleep quality and overall respiratory health.</p></p>
