<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Wind Tunnel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Circuit</li><li>Open Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive wind tunnel market is primarily divided into two types: closed circuit and open circuit wind tunnels. Closed circuit wind tunnels recycle the air within a contained loop, allowing for consistent and controlled testing conditions, making them ideal for precise aerodynamic studies. In contrast, open circuit wind tunnels draw in ambient air, exhaust it after testing, and are generally less expensive to operate. Each type serves different testing needs, with closed circuits favored for detailed research and open circuits often used for quicker evaluations.</p></p>
