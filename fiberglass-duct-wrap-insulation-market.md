<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiberglass Duct Wrap Insulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Facings</li><li>Without Facings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiberglass duct wrap insulation market is categorized into two main types based on the presence of facings. "With facings" insulation features a vapor-retardant or protective layer, enhancing moisture resistance and improving air-tightness, making it suitable for various HVAC applications. "Without facings" insulation lacks this additional layer, offering flexibility and ease of installation in less demanding environments. Both types provide effective thermal resistance, but the choice between them depends on specific insulation needs, moisture control requirements, and installation conditions.</p></p>
